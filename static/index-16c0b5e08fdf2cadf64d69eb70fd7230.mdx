## Ingredients

<IngredientList
  ingredients={[
    "2 sweet potatoes, cubed",
    "2 Apples, cubed",
    "Olive Oil",
    "1 small onion, diced",
    "1 tbs garlic, minced",
    "Salt",
    "Pepper",
    "1 tbs Cinnamon",
    "2 tbs of Brown Sugar, White Sugar, Honey",
  ]}
/>

## Recipe

Add oil to pan over medium heat. Add onions and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden, add more oil if necessary. Remove onions and garlic from heat. Add sweet potatoes and cook until slightly underdone then add apples and onion mixture to pan.

Continue cooking until sweet potatoes have the texture of potato salad. Like, some sweet potatoes falling apart, apples still have a bite, and onions tender and sweet.

Finish with cinnamon and sweetener. Cook just until sugar has dissolved into a syrup and is mixed well.

## Notes

Fresh herbs could be good to finish here. Maybe sage or rosemary.

Maybe toasted chopped nuts on the finish too.
