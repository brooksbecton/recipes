## Recipe

A lot of the recipe depends on the type of steak. Steaks like double cuts and bone-ins will 
take a lot longer and may need a slightly slower  temp than s a thinner cut that is going 
to be more common on the super market. 

 Pat steak down with paper towl to remove moisture
 Salt and pepper steak, put on wire rack to dry brine half a day
 Depending on how thin the steak is, you'll want to let the steak come up to room temp.
 Start heating up cast iron on 6 the thinner the steak the higher the heat needs to be
 Pat steak dry again
 Once the pan is pre heated add steak and press down lightly to increase contact to pan
 This all will all go very quickly. I tried to temp while cooking last time, but it 
 was too cumbersome. This will really have to be a look and feel thing. 

 Once one side is seared, flip and cook until the other side should be about 75% seared.
 Throw in butter, herbs, and garlic. Allow butter to cook vegetables. Before the butter browns, 
 start basting the steaks in butter for 30 seconds. 

 Remove steak from pan to a wire rack to rest for 10-15 minutes. 

 You can pre cut the steak and toss the cuts in the drippings. This is preferred unless you 
 are trying to impress someone. It ensures that the steak taste juicy. 


## Notes

### Wedding Anniversary 

Didn't let cast iron come up to heat enough. Had to over cook it to get a sear


### Knoxville Double Cut

Super thick steak and tried to could typically. Came out raw and had to keep searing. 
Should have reverse seared.
